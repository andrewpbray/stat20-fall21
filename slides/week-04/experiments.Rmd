--

## Collect the best ideas into 4 principles

--

## Get to _why_ these principles are important

# Principles of Experimental Design

**Randomization**: Randomly assign subjects to treatments.

**Control**: Compare treatment of interest to a control group that isolates the effect of interest.

**Blinding**: When experimental units do not know whether they are in the control or treatment group

**Replication**: Within a study, replicate by collecting a sufficiently large sample. Or replicate the entire study.


---
# Other key ideas

**Placebo**: fake treatment, often used as the control group for medical studies

**Placebo effect**: experimental units showing improvement simply because they believe they are receiving a special treatment

**Blocking**: If there are variables that are known or suspected to affect the response variable, first group subjects into blocks based on these variables, and then randomize cases within each block to treatment groups.

## The mounting evidence

--

- Randomized trials with mice and tobacco tar

--

- Regression models to "control for" possible confounders

--

- Identification of physical mechanism

--

- Twins studies

# Example 2: Acupuncture and pain

```{r out.width=500, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/acupuncture.png")
```

How do you test if acupuncture reduces pain?

--

"Sham acupuncture" is a good control.
