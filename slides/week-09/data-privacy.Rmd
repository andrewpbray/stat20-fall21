## While you're waiting...

Please flip a fair coin twice ([https://justflipacoin.com/](https://justflipacoin.com/)). Note the results but keep them to yourself. Later on I will ask everyone with an answer of "yes" to raise their hand according to the following rules.

- If your first coin came up H, respond to the Question 1: _Have you ever done an illegal drug? (ecstasy, MDMA, magic mushrooms, LSD, cocaine, etc)_

- If the first coin came up T, respond to the Question 2:, _Did your second coin come up H?_

In addition to being ready with your responses, think through why you would be comfortable saying it publicly or why it makes you uncomfortable.

## Key points

--
1. Privacy requires a good definition.

--
2. Differential privacy adds noise to keep amount learned about an individual within provable bounds.

--
3. There is a necessary balance with sensitive data between provide enough signal to be useful, but enough noise to ensure privacy.

## People's Park Survey

```{r echo = FALSE}
ppk <- read_csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/zamyjzlclortmtu/ppk.csv?dl=1")
ppk
```


---
## People's Park Survey

Noise was introduced by:

1. Bootstrapping the data set.
2. Each record has at least one permuted row in it.
