## Grammar of Graphics

Wilkinson 1999: A statistical graphic is a **mapping** of **data** variables to **aesthetic** attributes of **geometric** objects.

## Graphics for Categorical Data

## UN Votes over time

```{r fig.width = 8, echo = FALSE}
# load packages ------------------------------------------------------------
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(unvotes)
library(lubridate)
library(scales)
# plot unvotes by issues ---------------------------------------------------
un_votes %>%
  filter(country %in% c("United States", "Mexico", "Canada")) %>%
  inner_join(un_roll_calls, by = "rcid") %>%
  inner_join(un_roll_call_issues, by = "rcid") %>%
  mutate(vote = fct_relevel(vote, "yes", "no", "abstain")) %>%
  group_by(country, year = year(date), issue) %>%
  summarize(
    votes = n(),
    percent_yes = mean(vote == "yes"), 
    .groups = "drop_last"
  ) %>%
  filter(votes > 5) %>%  # only use records with more than 5 votes
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = percent_yes, color = country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ issue, labeller = label_wrap_gen(width = 20)) +
  labs(
    y = "% Yes",
    x = "Year",
    color = "Country"
  ) +
  scale_color_openintro("three") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 0.5, 1), labels = label_percent(scale = 100)) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.direction = "horizontal"
  )
```

Are these variables numerical? Categorical?

???
What are the variables? -> the columns of the data frame that were mapped onto the aesthetics that we see here.

---
## A look at the raw data

```{r echo = FALSE}
un_vote <- un_votes %>%
  left_join(un_roll_call_issues, by = c("rcid" = "rcid")) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  left_join(un_roll_calls, by = c("rcid" = "rcid")) %>%
  select(date, country, vote, issue)
```

```{r}
glimpse(un_vote)
```

---
##  Counts by Country

```{r vote_cnt, eval = FALSE}
un_vote %>%
  count(country) #<<
```

--

```{r ref.label="vote_cnt", echo = FALSE}
```

---
##  Counts by Country

```{r vote_cnt2, eval = FALSE}
un_vote %>%
  count(country) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) #<<
```

--

```{r ref.label="vote_cnt2", echo = FALSE}
```

---
##  Counts by Country

```{r vote_cnt3, eval = FALSE}
un_vote %>%
  count(country) %>%
  arrange(n) #<<
```

--

```{r ref.label="vote_cnt3", echo = FALSE}
```

---
##  Counts by Country

```{r vote_bar1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(un_vote, aes(x = country)) +
  geom_bar()
```

--

```{r ref.label="vote_bar1", echo = FALSE, fig.height=4}
```

---
##  Counts by Country

Focus on North America: `r emo::ji("canada")` `r emo::ji("us")` `r emo::ji("mexico")`

--

.pull-left[
```{r echo = FALSE}
na_vote <- un_vote %>%
  filter(country %in% c("United States", "Mexico", "Canada"))
```

```{r}
na_vote %>%
  count(country)
```

]

--

.pull_right[
```{r fig.height = 3.5}
ggplot(na_vote, aes(x = country)) +
  geom_bar()
```
]

---
## Counts by Country and Issue

How can this be turned into a bar chart?

--

```{r}
na_vote %>%
  count(country, issue)
```

---
##  Counts by Country x Issue

```{r echo = FALSE}
na_vote <- na_vote %>%
  unite("country_x_issue", 
        country, 
        issue, 
        remove = FALSE)
```

Create a bar for each combination of categories.

--

```{r fig.height = 4, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(na_vote, aes(x = country_x_issue)) +
  geom_bar()
```

**Question**: What does this tell us?

--

> Of *all votes cast*, how many were for each county x issue combination?

---
## Counts of Issue by Country

--

.pull-left[
```{r issue_by_country, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(na_vote, 
       aes(x = country,
           fill = issue)) +
  geom_bar()
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="issue_by_country", echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
```
]

**Question**: What does this tell us?

--

> Of *all votes cast by each country*, how many were on each issue?

---
## Counts of Country by Issue

--

.pull-left[
```{r country_by_issue, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(na_vote, 
       aes(x = issue, #<<
           fill = country)) + #<<
  geom_bar()
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="country_by_issue", echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
```
]

**Question**: What does this tell us?

--

> Of *all votes cast on each issue*, how many were by each country?

---
## Proportions of Country by Issue

--

.pull-left[
```{r country_by_issue_p, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(na_vote, 
       aes(x = issue,
           fill = country)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") #<<
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="country_by_issue_p", echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
```
]

**Question**: What does this tell us?

--

> Of *all votes cast on each issue*, what *proportion* were for by each country?

---
## Proportions of Country by Issue

--

.pull-left[
```{r issue_by_country_p, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(na_vote, 
       aes(x = country, #<<
           fill = issue)) + #<<
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="issue_by_country_p", echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
```
]

**Question**: What does this tell us?

--

> Of *all votes cast by each country*, what *proportion* were for on each issue?

---
## But wait, there's more

These plots show little difference in the data (the counts, the proportions). What other variable might contain interesting variability?

--

```{r echo = FALSE}
na_vote <- na_vote %>%
  select(-country_x_issue)
```

```{r}
glimpse(na_vote)
```

--

> `vote`

--

**Question**: How do you visualize *three* categorical variables?

---
## Facets

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="45%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/grammar-of-graphics.png")
# source: http://bloggotype.blogspot.com/2016/08/holiday-notes2-grammar-of-graphics.html
```

*Facets* are multiple versions of the same plot, each using a different subset of the data determined by a categorical variable.

--

```{css, echo = FALSE}
.huge .remark-code { /*Change made here*/
  font-size: 150% !important;
}
```

.huge[
```{r}
facet_wrap(vars())
```
]

---
# Facets example

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/ft-covid-excess-deaths.png")
#Source: [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/a2901ce8-5eb7-4633-b89c-cbdf5b386938), 27 Aug 2021.
```

---
## Proportion of country by issue and vote

.pull-left[
```{r facet1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(na_vote,
       aes(x = issue,
           fill = country)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  facet_wrap(vars(vote))
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "facet1", echo = FALSE, fig.height=5}
```

]

---
## Proportion of vote by country and issue

.pull-left[
```{r facet2, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(na_vote,
       aes(x = country,
           fill = vote)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  facet_wrap(vars(issue))
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "facet2", echo = FALSE, fig.height=5}
```

]

---
## Themes

The design choices not related to the data - the colors used, the fonts, the spacing, the construction of each component - are encapsulated in the **theme**.

--

.pull-left[
```{r penguins-10, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(ggthemes)
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm,
                     y = bill_length_mm,
                     colour = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Bill depth and length",
       subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
       x = "Bill depth (mm)", y = "Bill length (mm)",
       colour = "Species",
       caption = "Source: Palmer Station LTER / palmerpenguins package") +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() #<<
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "penguins-10", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.width = 8, message = FALSE}
```
]
