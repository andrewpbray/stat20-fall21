## Scope of Inference

**population** - the set of observational units on which you wish to make an inference (size: $N$)

--

#### Scales of Data

**sample** - a subset of the population on which you have data (size of the sample: $n$)

--

**anecdote** - very small sample of data collected haphazardly (usually $n = 1$)

--

**census** - sample = population (complex, expensive, and sometimes impossible to achieve)

---

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
library(stat20data)
data("arbuthnot")
arbuthnot <- arbuthnot %>%
  mutate(p_boys = boys / (boys + girls))
ggplot(arbuthnot, aes(x = year,
                      y = p_boys)) +
  geom_line() +
  ylim(0, 1)
```

> *Descriptive Claim*: In every year from 1629 - 1710, in the London parishes under study, the proportion of christenings that were male exceeded 50%.

--

- Scope of inference is limited to the **sample** of data
- Focuses purely on the **statistics** of the sample: numerical summaries of the data (yearly observed proportions)

---

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
library(stat20data)
data("arbuthnot")
arbuthnot <- arbuthnot %>%
  mutate(p_boys = boys / (boys + girls))
ggplot(arbuthnot, aes(x = year,
                      y = p_boys)) +
  geom_line() +
  ylim(0, 1)
```

> *Inferential Claim*: The proportion of births that are genetically male exceeds 50%.

--

- Scope of inference is the **population** of all births, with no geographic, cultural, or temporal caveats
- Uses the **statistics** of the sample to infer the nature of the **parameters** of the population: numerical characteristics of the population (the proportion of births than are genetically male)


---
## Scope of Inference

When studying the relationships between multiple variables, some inferences are of **associations**, others assert a **causal link**. These often map to the nature of the data.
--

### Collection methods

- **Observational Data**: passive recording of variables on a sample
- **Experimental Data**: researchers actively assign treatments to observational units then record variables

Both often involve the process of drawing a sample.

---
## Analogy: Sampling as Cooking

--

```{r out.width=220, echo = FALSE, fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/soup.png")
```

--

- To evaluate if the soup is good, you taste a spoonful - *sample.*

--

- If the spoonful is bland, you've made a *descriptive claim*.

--

- If you conclude the soup needs salt, you've made an *inference to a population*.

--

- For it to be valid, the spoonful must be *representative* of the soup.

# Sampling considerations

You're a senior Psychology major conducting a study that examines procrastination among Cal students.  How should you select a sample?

--

**A.** Post a link to your survey on social media.

--

**B.** Get a list of Cal student emails from the Registrar, take a simple random sample (SRS), and email that sample.

## Landon v. FDR, 1936

Literary Digest polled 10 million Americans, 2.4 million responded.

--

N = 128 million, n = 2.4 million

--

**Prediction**: 43% for FDR

**Result**: 62% for FDR

---

## What went wrong?

--

Literary Digest surveyed

- magazine subscribers
- registered car owners
- registered telephone owners

--

These groups have a much higher income on average than the typical
american. In 1936 the Great Depression is still in full swing, so the 
typical (poorer) american was more supportive of FDR.

Their sampling method was **biased** (not representative).

Sampling Strategies

---
## Sampling Strategies
--

### Simple Random Sampling (SRS)
Select from the population of size $N$ a sample of size $n$ where each observational unit is equally likely of being selected.

--

### Stratified Sampling
Divide the population up into *strata*, then take a SRS within each stratum.

---
## Example: MLB Salaries

Imagine we have access to the full population 160 baseball players (focus on Yankees, Padres, Mariners, and Dodgers), and record their team name and salary.

--

```{r strat-samp, echo = FALSE}
team <- c(rep("New York Yankees", 40), 
           rep("San Diego Padres", 40), 
           rep("Seattle Mariners", 40), 
           rep("Los Angeles Dodgers", 40))
salary <- c(rnorm(40, mean = 25), 
            rnorm(40, 16), 
            rnorm(40, 23), 
            rnorm(40, 15))
df <- data.frame(team, salary)
head(df)
```

---
## Population view
--

```{r plot-strat, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
library(tidyverse)
df %>%
  mutate(name = team) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = salary, fill = name)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = .8) +
  geom_rug(aes(color = name))
```

--

How can we estimate the **population mean salary** (with $N = 160$) using only a sample of size $n = 40$?

--

- Take a sample, compute the *sample mean*
- But how should we take the sample?

---
## Simple Random Sample (SRS)

**Population Mean**

```{r}
df %>% 
  summarize(mean(salary))
```

--

**Sample Mean from an SRS**

```{r}
# SRS
df %>%
  sample_n(40) %>% 
  summarize(mean(salary))
```

---
## Stratified Sample

--

**Sample Mean from an Stratified Sample**

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(team) %>% 
  sample_n(10) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  summarize(mean(salary))
```

---
## Long-run performance

To understand how these strategies perform in the long run, we have to imagine how good the parameter estimates will be over *many* possible samples.

--

```{r}
df %>%
  sample_n(40) %>% 
  summarize(mean(salary))
```

--

```{r}
df %>%
  sample_n(40) %>% 
  summarize(mean(salary))
```


---
## Long-run performance


```{r comp, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width=12, fig.height = 8, message=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(mosaic)
SRS <- do(1000) * mean(~salary, data = sample(df, 40))
STR <- do(1000) * mean(~salary, data = rbind(sample(subset(df, team == "New York Yankees"), 10),
                                             sample(subset(df, team == "San Diego Padres"), 10),
                                             sample(subset(df, team == "Seattle Mariners"), 10),
                                             sample(subset(df, team == "Los Angeles Dodgers"), 10)))
sim <- data.frame(salary = rbind(SRS, STR), method = rep(c("SRS", "STR"), each = 1000))
ggplot(sim, aes(x = mean, fill = method)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .7) +
  annotate("segment", x = mean(df$salary), xend = mean(df$salary),
           y = 0, yend = 3, color = "black", linetype = 2) +
  theme_bw()
```

---
## Sampling Strategies

--

**SRS**: Unbiased, easy, but can be highly variable.

--

**Stratified Sampling**: If you divide population into strata that are *similar* within and *different* between, your estimates will still be unbiased but have lower variability.
