- The Wolf River in Tennessee flows past an abandoned site once used by the 
pesticide industry for dumping wastes, including hexachlorobenzene (HCB).
- HCB known to cause various cancers and birth defects.


---
# Wolf River study
--

- Standard method to test whether HCB is present in a river is to take samples at middepth.

--
- **Question: is it found at different concentrations at different depths?**

# ANOVA F-test

$$ H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \ldots = \mu_k $$
$$ H_A: \textrm{At least one } \mu_j \textrm{ is different} $$

--

We can find the distribution of the F-statistic under the null hypothesis by

- Permutation
- Mathematical approximation

--

Permutation null:

$H_0$: HCB level is independent of depth.

## Null dist for F stat
--

```{r randoF2, eval = FALSE}
null <- wolf %>%
  specify(response = HCB, 
          explanatory = Depth) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, 
           type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "F")
null
```
--
```{r ref.label = "randoF2", echo = FALSE}
```


---
## Null dist for F stat, cont.
--

```{r nullplot, echo = FALSE}
null %>%
  visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_stat,
                direction = "right")
```

--

```{r ref.label="nullplot", echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.align="center"}

```



---
## Null dist for F stat, cont.
--

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height = 5}
null %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_stat, 
              direction = "right")
```


---
## Null dist for F via Approximation

If:

1. Independent observations.
2. Approximate normal distributions within groups.
3. Constant variance between groups.

--

Then the sampling distribution for the $F$ statistic under the $H_0$ is well approximated by an F distribution with $df_1 = k - 1$ and $df_2 = N - k$. The p-value is represented by the upper tail.

```{r echo = FALSE}
obsstat <- pull(obs_stat)
```


```{r f-output}
1 - pf(obsstat, df1 = 2, df2 = 30 - 3)
```

---

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height = 5, warning = FALSE}
null %>%
  visualize(method = "both") +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_stat,
                direction = "right")
```


---
## Wolf River Conclusions
--

```{r conc, , fig.align="center", fig.height = 4, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(wolf, aes(x = Depth, y = HCB)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw()
```

- With a p-value of $\approx 0.07$, it is questionable whether HCB concentration
functions the same at all three depths.
- *Replicating the study* could add some certainty.
- In a subsequent study, we may wish to only test middepth versus bottom.
