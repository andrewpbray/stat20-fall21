## Classical Tools of Inference
--

.pull-left[
**Hypothesis Test**

Asserts properties of the population and it's parameters. Evaluates if the observed data is consistent with that assertion.
]

--

.pull-left[
**Confidence Intervals**

Establishes an interval (LB, UB) that conveys the uncertainty in a point estimate of a parameter.
]

---

**Question**: Based on their survey of ~1600 students, the Chancellor's Office estimates that 68% of _all_ Berkeley students support the People's Park Project. With a confidence level of 99%, they have a margin of error of 3%. Which is a correct statement regarding the corresponding confidence interval?

1. There is a 99% probability that the true proportion of all Berkeley students who support the project is between 65% and 71%.

2. If we were to collect many other samples of size ~1600 and construct many such intervals, we'd expect 95\% of them to contain the population parameter.

3. If the sample size had been ~3200, the 99% confidence interval would be narrower than 65% to 71%.

```{r echo = FALSE}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 0, seconds = 30, warn_when = 10)
```

**Question**: For which study(ies) might it be reasonable to generalize the result to the broader population?

## Two Distinct Types of Claims
--

.pull-left[
**Generalization**

Makes statement about the parameters of a population based on the statistics measured on a small sample of data. Requires both a representative sample and statistical significance.
]

.pull-right[
**Causal Claim**

Claims the association found in the data is in fact causal. Requires randomized controlled trial (RCT) or multi-facetted observational evidence.
]
