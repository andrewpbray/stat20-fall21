# Hypothesis Testing via Permutation and Simulation

---

## Parameters and Statistics

--

**Parameter**: A numerical characteristic/property/summary of a _population_.

--
**Statistic**: A numerical characteristic/property/summary of a _sample_.

--

Compare the _parameters_ from the class population to the _statistics_ from Amanda's 8 am section regarding Midterm 1 Again.

--

.pull-left[
In the class:
- The mean grade was 90%: $\mu = 90\%$
- The proportion of students who took it was 85%: $p = 85\%$
]

--

.pull-right[
In the 8 am section:
- The mean grade was 94%: $\bar{x} = 94\%$
- The proportion of students who took it was 88%: $\hat{p} = 88\%$
]

## Example: Gender Discrimination

.pull-left[
```{r out.width=600, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/equal-pay.jpg")
```
]

.pull-right[  
  - 48 male supervisors given the same personnel file.
  - Asked: promote or not.
  - Files were identical except gender.
  - Files were randomly assigned to the supervisors.
  - Goal: are females unfairly discriminated against?
]

---

## Example: Gender Discrimination

.pull-left[
```{r out.width=600, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/equal-pay.jpg")
```
]

.pull-right[  
$H_0: p_M - p_F = 0$

$H_A: p_M - p_F \ne 0$

$p_M - p_F$ is a _parameter_.

$\hat{p}_M - \hat{p}_F = .87 - .58 = .29$ is a _statistic_.
]

---
## Example: Seeded Yawning

.pull-left[
```{r out.width=600, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/dog-yawn.png")
```
]

.pull-right[  
- 50 volunteers randomly assigned to either seeded or unseeded.
- Monitored for yawn or not.
- Goal: does being in the seeded group affect the chance that you'll yawn?
]

---
## Example: Seeded Yawning

.pull-left[
```{r out.width=600, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/dog-yawn.png")
```
]

.pull-right[  
$H_0: p_S - p_U = 0$

$H_A: p_S - p_U \ne 0$

$p_S - p_U$ is a _parameter_.

$\hat{p}_S - \hat{p}_U = .29 - .25 = .04$ is a _statistic_.

# A Framework for Classical Inference

## Finding the Null Distribution: Permutation

We can shuffle or **permute** the data in one of the variables to generate the kind of data we would expect under a null hypothesis of _independence_ between the two variables.

---

## Recall

RVs $X$ and $Y$ are _independent_ if

$$P(Y\,|\,X) = P(Y)$$

--

Let $Y$ be whether a promotion decision and let $X$ be the gender most often associated with the name on the file.

--

$$Y \sim \textrm{Bin}(p)$$

--

If $Y$ is independent of $X$, then,


$$P(Y\,|\,X = M) = P(Y\,|\,X = F) = P(Y)$$

The distribution of $Y$ should be the same across values of $X$ and $p_M - p_F = 0$

# A Different Kind of Null

## Millenials and same-sex marriage

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Question]

In the national debate on same-sex marriage, it is commonly stated that half of all Americans favor same-sex marriage.  In 2014, Pew research conducted a poll of millennials (Americans born after 1980) and found that 67% answered yes when asked: "Do you favor same-sex marriage?"  The poll was a random sample of 75 millennials.  Does this poll provide convincing evidence that the opinion of millennials is different from those of Americans at large?

What is the parameter value that will form our null hypothesis?

## Finding the Null Distribution: Taking Draws

If a null hypothesis concerns a particular value that a proportion should take (a _point_ null), then you can generate data under that null hypothesis by taking **draws** from that distribution.

.task[
Explain how you could use cards, a coin, or a die to simulate the process of collecting data from using a survey of 75 people if half of millenials favor same-sex marriage.

Discuss with your neighbors and prepare to be called on.

- Our data is inconsistent with the hypothesis that millenials support same sex marriage at the same rate as Americans in general.
- We reject the null hypothesis that $p = .5$ at an $\alpha$ level of .05.
